# Careers in IT and computers

These are some notes I put together for an inquisitive young man, having to make some career decisions. This document is not meant to be a complete guide, for that, please see a career councillor.  

My own field is computational radiometry, a specialised branch in computational physics - if you need some advice send me an email neliswillers@gmail.com.

If you are not interested in learning a computer language, don't even bother to read further. If you are interested, see my advice near the end of this document.

## Possible careers in IT/computers

There is a rich set of possible careers in the broader scope of IT/computers.  

For most people 'IT' means 'something to do with computers', but there is a huge spread of different opportunities. Some opportunities are in business, companies and organisations. Some more opportunities are in web development.  But there are also many other opportunities are in science, data processing, embedded programming, computer design, etc.

google: [careers in computers and information technology](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=careers+in+computers+and+information+technology) and see what pops up.

### Business/Management information systems

The field of business/management information systems has the objective to make large organisations work smoothly.  These systems use networks of computers, databases and various other tools to support the organisation in performing its work.  The focus is mainly on connecting people to computer-based business processes.  The work includes maintaining networks, computers, software, databases etc. It is all about making the business work.

### Web applications and multimedia 

Web applications is all about making the internet work, using all kinds of media and information.  D Users usually only see the web pages, but there is a huge infrastructure of networks and  databases behind the nice pages.  These networks and databases are similar to the BIS/MIS described above.  Web application development is a highly specialised field with special tools and techniques.

### Computer programming: computers and smartphones

Computer programmers are the people that make the computer do what the user wants it to do.  Programming is used in all of the various IT fields, but some people want to focus only on the programming details and not so much on the business processes. Programming can be done as a career, but is also often just a hobby.  Programming is in fact a basic skill that will help in almost all other careers, so irrespective of what you do, programming skills are essential in the modern world.

There are a large number of computer languages used to program computers, the most common languages are C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, PHP, SQL and many, many more.

There are many specialist areas in programming, some of which are:
1. Big data

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data  
2. Scientific programming, also known as computational science.  Using computers and programming to build computer programs that simulates some scientific field - the computational science approach allows us create virtual worlds in the computer that mimics some aspect of the real world.

### Computer engineering

Computer engineering is a branch of electronics that focuses on designing the computer hardware; from large computers to small boards the size of a coin.  Once the computer hardware is built, software must then also be written for these special computers; this is called embedded programming.

## Preparing for a career in IT/computers

1. Study the various fields defined above and make a decision before you leave high school. Depending on which of these areas you want to go into, you will have to enrol at different departments in college or university. Some careers require university degrees, other require college diplomas and yet other careers require on-the-job certification training.  Figure out what you want to do well before you have to enrol.

2.  While at high school try to read as much as you can about the field you want to work in.  Make sure that you really understand what the university entrance and eventual job requirements are.

3. Play, play, play.  In most of the IT/computer fields there are many open source tools offerings. These open source tools are free to download and free to use.  Some open source offerings are not well documented, but some have good documentation and even courses you can take.

4. Get to know Linux. It is perfectly possible that you can have a career in IT/computers without using Linux (Windows is adequate), but learning Linux opens your mind and brings an essential insight into operating systems and tools.  Download and learn Linux (get Debian or Ubuntu).

5. Learn a computer language. **This is compulsory, you must know a computer language.** Start now, today.  
My suggestion is to start with Python. Download and learn Python. There are many reasons why I recommend Python.  
  - Python is free and easy to learn. 
  - With Python you can start small and grow big later.
  - Python is a great general purpose language, but it can specialise to niche applications.
  - Python is very well documented, lots of free books and blogs.
  - The Python community is a really nice bunch of people: helpful and friendly.
  - My quick intro is [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/NelisW/ComputationalRadiometry/blob/master/02-PythonWhirlwindCheatSheet.ipynb), I show you how to download Python and where to find the documentation.  But there are many other sources as well, just google [starting python](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=starting+python) and see what pops up.
